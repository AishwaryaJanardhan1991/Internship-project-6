# Bike Sales Analysis - Excel Project for internship

This project is a comprehensive **data analysis of bike sales** using Microsoft Excel. It was completed as part of my internship project and focuses on deriving business insights from customer demographics and purchase behavior. The final output includes pivot tables, interactive dashboards, and visualizations.

# Objective
To analyze sales data of a bike store and derive key insights on how customer demographics influence purchasing decisions. This includes:
- Understanding customer segments
- Identifying key factors influencing bike purchase
- Visualizing data using pivot charts and dashboards
# Dataset Overview
The dataset includes various customer attributes:

| Column | Description 
| Customer ID - Unique customer identifier 
| First Name & Last Name - Name of the customer 
| Gender - Male / Female 
| Age - Customer's age 
| Education - Level of education 
| Marital Status - Married or Single

| Children - Number of children 
| Region - Customer location 
| Commute Distance  Daily commute range 
| Purchase Date  Date of purchase 
| Purchased Bike - Yes / No 
| Occupation - Customer's job title 

# Steps Performed
1. Data Cleaning
- Removed duplicate entries
- Checked for blanks and formatted data
- Ensured correct data types for each column (e.g., Income as numeric)
2. Pivot Table Creation
- Created multiple pivot tables to analyze trends:
- *Age vs Bike Purchase*
- *Gender Distribution of Buyers*
- *Commute Distance and Purchase Likelihood*
- *Education Level and Purchases*
- *Occupation-wise Bike Purchase*
- *Income and Purchase Correlation*
3.Visualizations
- Developed multiple *pivot charts and slicers*:
- Bar chart showing gender-wise purchase rate
- Line graph for age vs number of purchases
- Pie charts for marital status and education-level comparison
- Region-wise map representation 
4. Dashboard Creation
- Designed an *interactive dashboard* using slicers for:
- Gender
- Marital Status
- Commute Distance
- Region
- The dashboard dynamically updates pivot charts for deep dive insights.
# Key Insights
- *Gender & Purchase*: Males are slightly more likely to purchase a bike compared to females.
- *Age Group*: Peak bike purchases are seen in customers aged **35-45 years**.
- *Income Impact*: Customers with income above **$60,000** are more likely to purchase.
- *Marital Status*: Married individuals purchase more bikes than single customers.
- *Commute Distance*: Customers with commute distance of **2-10 miles** are highly likely to buy bikes.
- *Education Influence*: Higher education correlates with a greater likelihood of purchasing a bike.
